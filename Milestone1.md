<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how the various disconnects/terminations are handled</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The client gets disconnected voluntarily by calling the &#39;close()&#39; method on the socket<br>object (with the &#39;/disconnect&#39; command in the terminal). By doing so, the socket<br>terminates that connection between the Server and client.<div><br></div><div>The clients don&#39;t crash when the<br>server terminates due to the use of exception handling and client-server communication protocols.<br>The client code is built to catch SocketException and IOException by using try-catch<br>blocks, this helps the client handle the exception and prevents the program from<br>crashing. The client-server communication protocols (like TCP) provides reliable and ordered delivery of<br>data between server and client. When a server disconnects, the client can detect<br>this disconnection and then handle the situation by closing the connection and performing<br>any necessary cleanup tasks.</div><div><br></div><div>The server uses multithreading to stay alive when a client<br>disconnects. Each client connection is handled by a separate thread, which means that<br>when a client disconnects, only the thread associated with that client gets affected,<br>while the server and other threads with clients, remain unaffected. The server side<br>also uses exception handling to prevent the server from crashing, in case a<br>client disconnects.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>
